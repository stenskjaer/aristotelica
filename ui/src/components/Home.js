            <p>
              There already exists big amounts of data on on the Aristotelian tradition in other online archives. <em>Aristotelica</em> will enable import systems for collecting these dispersed sources into a coherent picture.

        <p>
          The <em>Aristotelica</em> project is started by Michael Stenskj√¶r Christensen as a framework the sources on Aristotle's <em>De anima</em> collected from existing catalogues for his PhD dissertation. This is reflected in the content of the database, as it currently almost only contains sources on <em>De anima</em>. But it is designed to be able to contain any sources from the Aristotelian Tradition.
