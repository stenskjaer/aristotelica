# Aristotelica â€“ A scholarly catalogue for the digital age

**THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**

This is the repository of the *Aristotelica* catalogue interface. Once completed this application will provide the most complete catalogue of commentaries on Aristotle's *De anima*, but this is only the beginning.

Aristotelica will: 
- Enable registration, browsing, and editing of scholarly data about the Aristotelian tradition.
- Be able to handle all kinds of Aristotelian commentaries.
- Be open to contributions from the scholarly community.
- Integrate with the [*Scholastical Commentaries and Texts Archive*](https://scta.info), an existing selection of software for metadata aggregation and first class digital text editing and preservation.

There is not yet any publicly availabe version of the website. This is only the repository for the source code.

## Tech stack

The main technologies are: 
- [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) Graph Database for main data persistence.
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) for database interface.
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) for the frontend.

## Context
